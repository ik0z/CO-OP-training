## All about : CO-OP training with MCIT


- [x]  The projects I worked on during the CO-OP training period 
- [x]  What should I expect in training with MCIT?

##### I spent 7 months ( 272 hours ) training with Ministry of Communications and Information Technology [(MCIT) ](https://www.mcit.gov.sa/) & Saudi Digital Academy [(SDA)](https://sda.edu.sa/).
###### With [Virtual Internships](https://www.virtualinternships.com/) & [Simplilearn](https://www.simplilearn.com/). 


##### There are two levels in training: 
- First level starts with SDA & Simplilearin (learning paths) :hourglass: [let's figure out](https://github.com/ik0z/CO-OP-training/tree/main/SDA-Simplilearning)
- Second level starts with SDA & Virtual Internships (work with the real company) :man_technologist: [let's figure out](https://github.com/ik0z/CO-OP-training/tree/main/SDA-VirtualInternships)
